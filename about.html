				<h2>What is Summit?</h2>

				<h3>Bhangra? Glass Blowing? Balloon Animal Making? Archery?</h3>

				<p> Looking for a fun way to start off your spring semester? Or perhaps the opportunity to try some activities outside your typical CMU schedule? Consider registering for Summit 2016, a weekend program taking place right before spring semester classes begin!</p>

				<br>
				<h3> The Experience </h3>
				<p> Summit participants will be able to return to campus and check-in on Friday, Jan 8th. That evening, there will be a dinner and casual late night activity to welcome back all Summit participants! Saturday and Sunday morning, Summit participants will have the chance to try out different activities in the Pittsburgh area and take workshops taught by other CMU students or faculty and staff on campus. </p>

				<br>
				<p><h3>In past years, activities have included: </h3></p>
				glass blowing, archery, firearm safety, pottery painting, massage therapy, bhangra dance, balloon animal making, origami, parkour and more! Check out our<a href="courses.html"> Courses</a> page to see previous classes.

				<p>
					Summit offers a great opportunity to experience new activities, meet others, and spend more time with your friends before classes begin. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Unfortunately Summit is not free, but the $30 registration fee is used to provide the six meals offered during Summit (past meals have been catered by Mad Mex, Yinzburgh BBQ, Curry on Murray, and other local Pittsburgh restaurants!) This year, registration will be limited to 50 Summit participants (with a wait list) so sign-up today to reserve your place! On-campus housing opens back up January 6th at 12pm according to CMU housing.

				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				
					<h3>When should I book a flight back to CMU?</h3>
					<p>Housing opens Jan 6, 2016 at 12pm if you're living on campus. Summit doesn't formally start until January 8th so you can come back some time between Jan 6 and Jan 8</p>

					<h3>When is Summit?</h3>
					<p>This year's SUMMIT is on Jan 8th, 9th, and 10th. This is the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday before spring semester. Check-in begins Jan 8th.</p>
					
					<h3>Is there a deadline to register?</h3>
					<p>Nope! But only the first 50 who register are guaranteed a spot to partake in Summit so make sure you register :) </p>

					<h3>How many courses can I take?</h3>
					<p>There will be 1.5 days of classes with 6 class blocks. The number of classes you partake in will depend on how you want to spend your time when back on campus </p>
					
					<h3>Can I get back into my room if I come back early for Summit?</h3>
					<p>Yep! Housing should be open January 6th, 2016 at 12pm according to CMU housing and dining. </p>

					<h3>I'm not a CMU student, can I partake in SUMMIT?</h3>
					<p>Nope! Sorry, SUMMIT is mostly funded through the activities fees that all students at CMU have to pay. We are also billing through CMU invoices.</p>
					
					<h3>Will I get a confirmation of my spot in SUMMIT?</h3>
					<p>You'll receive an email within a few days with confirmation :) </p>

					<h3>What do I do after registering? </h3>
					<p>That's it! You will be able to select classes at check in. Because we are having less students partake in Summit, it will be much less competitive to get into classes you are interested in! We will email you with any details that might change. </p>


					<h3>What if I registered but can't come anymore?</h3>
					<p>Contact us ASAP. The deadline to cancel your reservation for a refund is <strong>Dec 7th, 2015 </strong></p>
